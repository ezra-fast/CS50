//searching: "Is something that I'm looking for true or false?" (Does it exist or not)

//Quality of code and quality of performance are both equally important for programs.

//Efficiency of algorithms can be measured in: running time.

//Fewer steps for the same process are better.

//The running time of an algorithm can be described using O notation. (capital O)

//To streamline the running time of algorithms think of logs vs. division.

//If a for loop runs until i < n, then it runs O(n)

//The capital omega is used to notate how few an algorithm might take ("The lower bound measurement")

//Big theta is used to notate when the omega (lower bound) and O (upper bound order) for one algorithm are the same.

//The larger the upper bound is the longer the algorithm will take.

//When the algorithm is O(1) it is as fast as it can get.
