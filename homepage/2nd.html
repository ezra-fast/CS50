                <b>My name is Renaud Montpierres, and I am currently a student at Sorbonne University in Paris, France. At the institution, I am studying advanced aeronautical engineering, where I have attained a GPA of 3.9. Despite being a full-time student in Paris, I have a very wealthy family, and I frequently leave the area to travel around France and the surrounding Western European countries. Areas that I like to visit include Corse (France), Toulouse (France), Amsterdam (Netherlands), Brussels (Belgium), and Lisbon (Portugal). My hobbies include computer programming, calisthenic workouts and running, traveling, driving my family's various luxury cars, as well as shooting rounds down the range ("tirer" as they call it in France). I intend on traveling to more and more places as I get older, and would like to visit Africa, North America, South America, and Asia (better wear a mask there!). I particularly want to visit Brazil and Chile, to see the South American coast(s) and explore the Andes mountains. Click on the other links at the top of this page to learn some more about my running hobby, as well as my coding endeavors with CS50!</b>
