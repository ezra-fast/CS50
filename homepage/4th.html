                <i>While studying engineering at Sorbonne University in Paris, I decided to give CS50 a try. I was interested in learning to code at a basic level, and I had heard that CS50 was a good, albeit fast-paced, place to start. I would say that the lectures can be a bit long, as I find that lectures in excess of 1:30:00 to be overly drawn out. However, I understand that there is just too much material to cover in such a limited amount of time. I found the first problem sets, up to and including problem set 4, to be the most challenging, especially since the first part of the course introduces a completely different way of thinking about and solving problems. However, I have made it through and I am a better programmer because of it!</i>
